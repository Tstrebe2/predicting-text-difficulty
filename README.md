# predicting-text-difficulty

This is a collaborative milestone project for the University of Michigan Master of Applied Data Science program. In this project, we are working together in data science team of three to approach this the problem of predicting text difficulty. The data and non-code dependencies are located in the **assets** folder. All code assets, i.e. interactive Python notebooks, are located in the **notebooks** folder. There are no scripts in this repository

## Ethical considerations
The data and classifiers used for this project were used solely for academic purposes. We do not recommend using these data or notebooks to train a model for a real world text difficulty classification problem. There are certain domains and instances where literacy is crucial and can potentially lead to precarious situations. You can find many examples in the field of medicine where the usuall recommendation for prescription instructions and patient consent forms are written at the 6-8th grade level. Failure to understand these documents can have serious implications for patients. It is unlikely that a classifier training on this corpus would be able to generalize broad enough to be useful in a real world scenario.
